This relationship is used when you want to set up a many-to-many relationship through a third model, often called a join model. 

For example in the code below, subject would be the join model. 

```
class Teacher < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :subjects
  has_many :students, through: :subjects
end

class Subject < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :teacher
  belongs_to :student
end

class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :subjects
  has_many :teachers, through: :subjects
end
```


The join model typically contains foreign keys that connect the two other models (`Teacher` and `Student`).

Using the association `has_many :through` allows the primary model (`Teacher`) to interact with the associated models (`Student`) indirectly through the join model. This provides direct access to associated data across a multi step association.

`teacher.students`  # Returns all students associated with this teacher through subjects
`teacher.subjects`  # Returns all subjects taught by this teacher

Each `teacher` object can use `.students` to get a collection of students associated through the `subjects` join table and similarly `.subjects` to access all of the subjects they teach.

This setup effectively maps a many-to-many relationship between `Teacher` and `Student` using `Subject` as a connector, illustrating a practical use of the `has_many :through` association in rails.
